      <p>
        <strong>The space:</strong>Originally conceived as a soybean on pillars, over time it changes shape into an object adorned with a panoramic view through the huge portal of the front of the Maui Wikendaye that stretches across the river blue all the way to Koh Chang Island and Sr. Karlovac.
        The building is air-conditioned and fully equipped according to hotel standards. Wikendaya has a great wi-fi connection so you can work if it's inevitable :)
        The interior is dominated by oak, and on its 40m2 basically contains a kitchen, bathroom, terrace (10m2), corner sofa suitable for sleeping and underfloor heating is there only to complement the winter idyll. Oak staircase you climb to the gallery of 15m2 where there is a double wooden bed, a bed for a child, a wine showcase, tv... Images speak louder than words because waking up to the reflection of the sun's rays on the ceiling cannot be described in words
